# Analysis of Maple Leaf Rag

Maple Leaf Rag is one of the most influential ragtime piano pieces and has become a defining piece for the genre. It was composed by Scott Joplin for piano solo and published in 1899. The syncopated rhythms, which are typical of a ragtime piece, were very new in American music industry and quickly became popular. The concept of syncopated rhythms are said to have been borrowed from African music. The lyrics was written in 1903, 4 years after the piece was published. Ragtime along with Blues are believed to have given birth to jazz.

Some characteristics of ragtime pieces:
* Time Signature 2/4
* Syncopation (right hand melody aligned with upbeat)
* Octave separated unision chords with octave jumps for left hand
* Not dynamic intensive - playing piano roll or midi file will be very close to playing it live on a piano.
* Typical patterns are AABBACCDD, AABBACCCâ€² and AABBCCA
